How do I use in my Flask Container?

1. I could clone it during the build, and install it into the Docker Container?
pip install git+https://github.com/siliconmaze/my-shared-package

2. I could reference it as a local folder and install it into a container
 - create a container called my_shared_module
 - install the code on the file-system, and share are a volume with the flask container!
